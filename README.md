# Fantasy Football League Website

## Overview
This project is a **multi-page fantasy football league website** I created to showcase my skills as a junior software developer. The site demonstrates my ability to structure HTML pages, create reusable layouts, style content with CSS, and implement interactive features using JavaScript. The goal of this project was to build a fully functional portfolio piece that highlights both my technical knowledge and attention to user experience.  

The site includes multiple pages that provide a complete fantasy football experience, from viewing teams and standings to submitting start/sit requests.
